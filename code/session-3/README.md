# Session 3

## Task 1
see cta-button repository

## Task 2
* Add a button to add a new coloured circle in your "colored circles app" when it is pressed.
* You can use useState to store your colors in and be able to change them (and add a new one).  
For tips, look at the `checkbox-example` repository which shows the usage of `useState`.
